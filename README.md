Project Description

A fun browser-based Stress Relief App that combines lighthearted games and AI-powered stress detection tools to help users relax — all processed locally for privacy.

The Problem (that doesn’t exist)

People don’t have enough instant ways to procrastinate while claiming they are “working on mental health.”

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We built a single web app where you can play stress-busting games, take a stress quiz, and even have your face and voice analyzed for stress — all without sending data anywhere.
